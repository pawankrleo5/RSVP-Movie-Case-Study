SELECT 
 count(*) AS Count_genre FROM genre;
SELECT 
 count(*) AS Count_movie FROM movie;
SELECT 
 count(*) AS Count_names FROM names;
SELECT 
 count(*) AS Count_ratings FROM ratings;
SELECT  
 count(*) AS Count_role_mapping FROM role_mapping;



-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:

COUNT(*) AS ID_null FROM movie 
WHERE id IS NULL;

SELECT 
COUNT(*) AS Title_null FROM movie 
WHERE title IS NULL;

SELECT 
COUNT(*) AS Year_null FROM movie 
WHERE year IS NULL;
